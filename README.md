# Suwayomi Downloader for KOReader

A KOReader plugin that allows you to browse your self-hosted [Suwayomi (Tachidesk)](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server) server and download chapters directly to your e-ink device.

## Development Status

This plugin is experimental and still under active development.

- Expect rough edges and incomplete features.
- The login flow, source browsing, manga browsing, chapter browsing, chapter actions menu, single-chapter downloads, and read-state syncing are currently implemented and being tested.
- At the moment, the plugin is only considered usable with the Suwayomi **Local Source**.
- Bulk selection and bulk downloads are not complete yet.

## Features
- Native KOReader UI integration
- Browse sources, manga, and chapters directly from the server
- Basic auth login against a self-hosted Suwayomi server
- Filter sources by language
- Select a custom download directory
- Download individual chapters as `.cbz`
- Chapter actions menu with `Open`, `Download`, `Delete from device`, and `Mark as read` / `Mark as unread`
- Read-state tracking from Suwayomi, the local plugin ledger, and KOReader sidecar metadata
- Background retry of pending read/unread syncs when Suwayomi is temporarily unavailable

Current limitation:
- The practical, tested flow currently targets the Suwayomi **Local Source**. Other Suwayomi sources may browse correctly, but downloading and reading workflows outside Local Source are not yet considered supported.
